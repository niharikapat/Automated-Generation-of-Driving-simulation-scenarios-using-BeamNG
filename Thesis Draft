Thesis Draft: Automated Generation of Driving Simulation Scenarios from OpenStreetMap Data

1. Problem Statement

Creating realistic driving simulation scenarios is often a labor-intensive process that requires manual road modeling, object placement, and route definition. This limits the scalability and efficiency of simulation-based testing for autonomous vehicles and driver-assistance systems. There is currently no fully automated, open-source framework that can generate simulation-ready environments directly from public mapping sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM), while providing accurate GPS-level positional data for moving vehicles.

2. Topic Brief

This thesis explores the feasibility and development of an automated system capable of generating driving simulation scenarios directly from OSM or similar mapping data. The system aims to extract real-world map structures, transform them into simulation-compatible formats, and simulate vehicle movement with realistic GPS data within BeamNG interface. Python will serve as the core development language for automation, data handling, and scenario generation.

3. Research Direction and Methodology

The project will be conducted through the following steps:

1. Map Data Extraction: Use Python-based OSM tools (e.g., `osmnx`, `overpy`) to extract road networks, intersections, and metadata from selected regions.
2. Data Transformation: Convert extracted data into a format compatible with BeamNG scenario structures (.json/.prefab).
3. Scenario Generation: Automate the creation of scenarios including road layouts, spawn points, and AI vehicle routes.
4. Vehicle Simulation and GPS Emulation: Run simulations in BeamNG using its Python API to record positional data and emulate GPS readings.
5. Accuracy Evaluation: Compare simulated GPS coordinates against reference OSM data to assess accuracy, realism, and performance.
6. Feasibility Analysis: Review the entire process to evaluate technical viability, data precision, and potential challenges.

4. Objectives

  * Develop an automated workflow from OSM data to BeamNG driving simulation scenarios.
  * Implement vehicle trajectory generation with GPS data collection.
  * Evaluate accuracy of positional and mapping data within simulations.
  * Assess feasibility, limitations, and improvement potential for automated scenario generation.

5. Tools and Technologies

  * Simulation Platform: BeamNG.drive
  * Programming Environment: Python
  * Map Data Source: OpenStreetMap (via OSMnx, Overpy, or Overpass API)
  * Data Analysis Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Plotly
  * Coordinate Systems: WGS84 (OSM data), UTM for GPS accuracy validation

6. Expected Results

  * A validated workflow demonstrating how real-world OSM data can be used to generate simulation environments.
  * GPS-based vehicle movement within BeamNG that aligns with real map geometry.
  * Quantitative analysis of positional accuracy and transformation fidelity.
  * A documented feasibility conclusion indicating whether fully automated OSM-to-simulation conversion is practically achievable.

7. Deliverables

* Working Prototype:
    If research and implementation confirm feasibility, the final deliverable will be a functional Python-based prototype capable of automatically generating BeamNG scenarios from      OSM data, including road networks and vehicle routes with GPS tracking.

* Feasibility Report and Research Review:
    If the research indicates limitations or infeasibility, the deliverable will be a comprehensive analysis compiling previous academic and industry studies that attempted similar     integrations (OSM → simulation) and identifying the core reasons they were unsuccessful.

* Documentation:
    Full technical documentation covering system design, data flow, algorithms used, and evaluation methodology.

* Evaluation Dataset:
    Collection of test cases (e.g., different regions, terrain types) and corresponding accuracy metrics for GPS and simulation output.
